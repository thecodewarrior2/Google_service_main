# Changelog

## 0.1.0: first testing version

- **Worker:**
  - takes Gmail notifications through Pub/Sub and reads new Inbox messages (raw) through domain-wide
    delegation, without a key file;
  - judges them with the S.P.R.U.C.E+ extension's checks and phish-tiny model (extension 5.94.6,
    model 0.4.0; `vendor/spruce/`);
  - moves to Spam when the rules flag a message, or when the AI scores 85% or more for an outside sender.
- **Safety:**
  - monitor mode by default;
  - the AI score alone never moves inside mail;
  - allowlists;
  - a brake (moves per hour) that pauses moving until an admin resumes;
  - releases recorded with who did them.
- **Dashboard** behind Identity-Aware Proxy for `ADMIN_EMAILS`:
  - overview, campaigns, users, messages with each decision;
  - Release, Mark false alarm, Confirm phishing;
  - model health and settings.
  - Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, light and dark, works on a phone.
- **Records** in Firestore with no email bodies, deleted after 60 days. Daily jobs renew watches and
  delete old records; a task stops every watch.
- **Two Cloud Run services from one image** (`ROLE=worker`, `ROLE=admin`).
- **Demo mode** with an invented district: every record is judged by the real engine; it refuses Cloud
  Run. `tools/build-mockup.js` makes a one-file clickable mockup of the dashboard.
- **Tests:** engine, HTML reading, policy, pipeline (fake Gmail), brake, release, watches, retention,
  authorization of every route, and the dashboard API on the demo data.
- **Known:** `npm audit` reports 6 moderate advisories in dependencies of the Firestore client library
  (`minimatch` and `rimraf` used for file-path matching, not reachable with email content);
  `npm audit fix` can't resolve them without breaking changes.
